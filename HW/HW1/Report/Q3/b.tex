\subsection{part b}
C is the event when two positive tests happen.
The probability of two positive tests if someone has flu:
$$
P(B)P(A\vert B)P(A\vert B) = 0.049
$$
The probability of two positive tests if someone doesn't have flu:
$$
P(\bar B)P(A\vert \bar B)P(A\vert \bar B) = 9.5\times10^{-5}
$$

$$
P(C) = P(B)P(A\vert B)P(A\vert B) + P(\bar B)P(A\vert \bar B)P(A\vert \bar B) = 0.0491
$$

$$
P(B\vert C) = \dfrac{P(B\cap C)}{P(C)} = 0.998
$$
