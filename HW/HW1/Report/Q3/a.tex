\section{Question 3}
$$
\text{A positive test is A event:} P(A),\quad \text{Having the flu is B event: } P(B) = 0.05
$$
\subsection{part a}
The probability of a positive test if someone has flu:
$$
P(A \vert B) = 0.99
$$
The probability of a positive test if someone doesn't have flu:
$$
P(A \vert \bar B) = 0.01
$$

$$
P(A) = P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap \bar B) = P(A \vert B)P(B) + P(A \vert \bar B)P(\bar B) = 0.99 \times 0.05 + 0.01 \times 0.95 = 0.059
$$

$$
P(A\vert B)P(B) = P(B\vert A)P(A) \rightarrow P(B\vert A) = \dfrac{P(A\vert B)P(B)}{P(A)} = 0.84
$$
