For a WSS process:
\begin{align*}
    R_X(0) &= E[x(t)x(t)]\\
    R_X(\tau) &= R_X(-\tau)
\end{align*}
That is true in this stochastic process.
%  if $\omega = 0$.
where $R_X(\tau)$:
$$
R_X(\tau) = E\left[x(t+\dfrac{\tau}{2})x^*(t-\dfrac{\tau}{2})\right]
$$


An ergodic process is a stationary random process for which:
\begin{align*}
    A[x(t)] = E[x(t)]\\
    R[x(t, \tau)] = R_X(\tau)
\end{align*}

$$
A[x(t)] \not= E[x(t)]
$$
so this stochastic process is not ergodic.
